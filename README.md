# Quantum Rubik's Cube Solver
This repository consists of a jupyter notebook and a write-up that detail our solution for solving a 2x2x0 Rubikâ€™s cube through representing it as a Markov chain and using a quantum search algorithm. This allowed us to obtain a speedup over any classical algorithm by taking advantage of quantum superposition and parallel computation, particularly in the case of sequences with a large number of moves. We would also be able to potentially extend this work to larger and more complex problems given the requisite hardware while maintaining the computational advantages provided by quantum computing.

For our actual code, reference the jupyter notebook rubiks_solver.ipynb, and for a more in-depth description of our problem setup, algorithm, and results, reference the write-up in writeup.pdf.
